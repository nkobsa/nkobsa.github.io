//What was your favorite lab and why?

My favorite project was learning how to customize Google API maps for websites. I found this really fascinating and fun (and also really frustrating) and loved playing around with customizing my map. Maps are incredibly important for customizing websites, and it was great to learn how accessible it is to add a map to a website using Google Developer resources. 

//How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?  What did you learn about yourself?

I have grown quite a bit in this course, mostly through gaining a great introduction to the world of web development. I was really amazed how many resources there are out there for putting together websites. There is also a very friendly and open culture of helping one another with web development online through community and tech forums. However I learned that I am so much better learning in an environment with in-person contact. I do not like feeling disoriented in a field, so I have to still work on being comfortable diving into the deep end. In the end my goal was to learn how in the world websites and the internet works, so having now understood that to an introductory extent, I feel the course was very worthwile to me. 

//What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.

My largest takeaway from this course was how complex functioning websites are to create. You must think about the website from all angles including usability, design, function, user interface, and perhaps most importantly: security. Two important components of security include never trusting user input and planning for unexpected data entries. You also have to plan your website's security from the start, and continuously identify all possible vulnerabilities. 

//Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?

I am very interested in the user experience part of web development, rather than the front or back end development. I would like to delve deeper into human computer interaction, including the psychology of users testing products, ergonomics, and user interface design. I am also very interested in data science and analysis. 

//What would you differently in the future?

In the future I would definitely not take an online course again in a subject that I am not already familiar with. I feel I would have been much more successful and completed the course during a fall or spring semester. I know it is not lack of interest or ability that tripped me up with this course, but more my learning style and needing more direction and support as a person who has little comp sci experience. I am interested in re-visiting web development/data science/user experience though a bootcamp, and also plan to look back at the labs and work through some of them on my own time.
